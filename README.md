# LinkedList in Assembly MIPS
## Description
I have implemented the linked list data structure in assemby MIPS and I have made a brief report in Italian that you can find in the repository and it is called "specifica.docx".
Being all sources written in assemby MIPS they are well commented to ensure an excellent reading of the source code.

## How to run the code
- install latest the java JVM
- clone the repository
- execute with java the file Mars4_5.jar
- inside the mars program is important to:
  - file > open and select the file sorgenti/main.asm
  - settings > check "assembre all files in directory"
- now you assemble and run the code
